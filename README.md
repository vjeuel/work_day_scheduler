# **Day Scheduler**
You can find the [day scheduler here](https://vjeuel.github.io/work_day_scheduler/).
<br>
In this app you can type your daily activities and it will be saved on local storage, so even if you refresh the page you are not losing the typed information.

There is a color coded feature, which is divided in 3 parts:

- Grey: Passed hours;
- Red: Current hour;
- Green: Coming hours;

Once typed, just click on the button next to the input field and the information will be saved and if your plans changed all you need to do is to re-type the new information and save again.
